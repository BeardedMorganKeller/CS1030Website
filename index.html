    <h1>Microphone Considerations for an Amateur Voice Actor</h1>

    <p>There are many microphones that are adequate to the task of capturing good voice work in the $150-$400 range. One might consider the <a href="https://www.rode.com/microphones/nt1">Rode NT1</a>, or the <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b">Shure SM7B</a> for instance. The Rode NT1 is a condenser microphone while the Shure SM7B is a dynamic microphone. In practice, this means that the Shure SM7B requires sound to reach a certain threshold to physically move the components that record sound, while the Rode NT1 will record everything that interrupts its electric signal.</p>

    <div class="image-container">

    <p>Because of this fundamental difference in sound capturing technology, there will be a wide difference in how and which sounds will be captured. The Shure SM7B is well-liked as a podcast microphone for the smoothness and bass boost it provides, and how it tends to not record things like cloth movement so much, while the Rode NT1 will capture a great deal of the nuance in a voice.</p>

    <p>Both are XLR microphones that will require an audio interface of some kind. Another consideration is cost. The Rode NT1 is much cheaper than the Shure SM7B. Since both microphones are XLR microphones they will require an audio interface as well that will likely start in the neighborhood of $200. A <a href="https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2">Scarlett 2i2</a> is relatively cheap, and all that is necessary if someone is only going to be doing voice work. If the user wants more possible inputs (such as more than two microphones recording at the same time, or additional instruments in a band) then they will need to consider more expensive and expansive audio interface options.</p>
